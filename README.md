RSGB Amateur Radio Licence Mock Exam Portal & Study Tool
How Our Dynamic Mock Exam System Works
Our mock exam system utilizes a dynamic **question bank of 100s of unique questions** to ensure you never take the same test twice. When you start any test (Foundation, Intermediate, or Full), the system intelligently selects a unique combination/variation of questions similar to the official exam's syllabus, weighting, and difficulty.

This progressive approach provides maximum preparation: not only do you learn the core content, but you also build crucial skills like time management and reading unfamiliar questions under pressure. Feel free to take the tests multiple times—each attempt will be fresh and challenging. "Since this is somewhat experimental coding, I would greatly appreciate your feedback."
⚠️ Important Disclaimer: Practice Tool Only
These mock tests are an independent **learning and practice tool** and are not affiliated with the Radio Society of Great Britain "RSGB" or any official examination body.
**Content Difference (No Diagrams):** These mock tests are entirely text-based. The real official exams may contain **diagrams, images, or figures**; these practice tests intentionally do not replicate that visual content.
The tests are designed to cover the syllabus but **do not exactly mirror** the specific wording or structure of any real-world official exam. Success here does not guarantee success on the official exam.
